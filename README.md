# City Country River
City Country River is an open source online party game similar to [Categories (game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_(game)). The name comes from 'Stadt Land Fluss' which is the german version of the game.

## Release

The game is still in early development and I don't know anything about servers and backend so it will still take a lot of time. I'm trying my best to get it done quickly. <br> Update 06/03/25: Setting up the server and database was very easy, but making the lobby system is really hard.

### Website URL
It **will** probably be https://ccr.alexander499.de, but I haven't set it up yet, since it's still in beta.
