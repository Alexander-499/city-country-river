# City Country River

City Country River is an open source online party game similar to [Categories (game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_(game)). The name comes from 'Stadt Land Fluss' which is the german version of the game.

## Release

The game is still in early development and I don't know anything about servers and backend so it will still take a lot of time. I'm trying my best to get it done quickly

### Website URL

I haven't even bought a domain yet, but I will. I will probably get a domain for me, and a sub-site of it will be the game.
